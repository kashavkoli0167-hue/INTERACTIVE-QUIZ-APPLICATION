PROJECT DESCRIPTION --
The Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of Task 1 of my internship. This project focuses on building a simple yet interactive quiz system that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback, and view their final score at the end of the quiz. The main purpose of this project is to strengthen my understanding of front-end web development fundamentals and JavaScript logic.
This application is designed especially for beginners and follows a clean and structured approach. It demonstrates how different web technologies work together to create an engaging user experience. The quiz interface is easy to use, visually appealing, and built with a dark-themed design that is comfortable for users who prefer working in low-light environments.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE --
The primary objective of this project is to learn and implement core concepts of JavaScript along with HTML and CSS. This includes:
- Understanding how to structure a web page using HTML
- Styling the user interface using CSS
- Implementing interactive behavior using JavaScript
- Handling user input and events
- Dynamically updating content using DOM manipulation
- Managing application flow and logic in a real-world scenario
- This project helped me move from basic theory to practical implementation.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
- HTML5--
  HTML is used to create the basic structure of the quiz application. It includes elements such as the quiz container, question area, option buttons, feedback text, and navigation buttons.
- CSS3--
 CSS is used to style the application and improve user experience. A modern dark theme is applied with smooth transitions, hover effects, and visual indicators for correct and incorrect answers. Button states      such as hover, disabled, and active are carefully handled to make the interface more interactive and user-friendly.
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)--
 JavaScript is the core of this project. It controls the quiz logic, including loading questions, checking answers, updating the score, showing feedback, and displaying the final result. JavaScript is also used    to enable and disable buttons, control visibility of elements, and restart the quiz without refreshing the page.

FEARURES OF THE APPLICATION
- Dynamic Question Loading-
 Questions are stored in a JavaScript array and loaded dynamically one by one.
- Multiple Choice Options-
 Each question contains four options, and users can select only one answer per question.
- Instant Feedback-
 After selecting an option, users immediately see whether their answer is correct or incorrect.
- Visual Feedback-
 Correct answers are highlighted in green and incorrect answers in red, improving clarity and user experience.
- Next Question Navigation-
 The "Next" button appears only after an answer is selected, ensuring proper quiz flow.
- Score Calculation-
 The score is calculated in real time and displayed at the end of the quiz.
- Restart Quiz Option-
 Users can restart the quiz after completion without reloading the page.
- Dark Mode UI-
 The application uses a dark color theme that looks modern and reduces eye strain.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
- By working on this project, I gained practical experience in:
- JavaScript functions and conditional logic
- DOM selection and manipulation
- Event handling using button clicks
- Debugging common JavaScript errors
- Writing clean and readable code
- Understanding how small UI changes affect user experience
- This project significantly improved my confidence in JavaScript and helped me understand how interactive web applications are built from scratch.

FUTURE IMPROVMENTS
- Some possible future enhancements include:
- Adding a timer for each question
- Displaying a progress bar
- Making the application fully responsive for mobile devices
- Adding more quiz categories
- Saving high scores using local storage
  
The Interactive Quiz Application is a beginner-level yet practical project that successfully demonstrates my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. It fulfills all the requirements of Task 1 of my internship and serves as a strong foundation for building more advanced web-based applications in the future.
